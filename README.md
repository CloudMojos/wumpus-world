# Wumpus World
How tf am I supposed to code this? LOL.

# The Parts
- The UI is written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features the **World**, a board that shows different components such as: **Pit**, **Breeze**, **Wumpus**, **Stench**, **Gold** and the **Agent**.
- The functionality is written in JavaScript. More details about how it works will be explained below.

# How I Approached the Problem
- I dunno don't ask me
- I can't find good tutorial to solve the problem alsdkfja;lhwiaru
- There will be three main classes: Agent, KnowledgeBase, and WumpusWorld.
- The Agent class is responsible for the agent's actions in the world. It will also be used to access its KnowledgeBase. The agent class will contain its own propositional logic to determine where to move during when.
- The KnowledgeBase class is responsible for holding information regarding to what the agent currently knows about the world. It includes visited cells,
unvisited cells, and others.
- The WumpusWorld class contains the tiles that the agent moves in. It also includes the rules of the game and the components such as Pit, Breeze, and Wumpus.
